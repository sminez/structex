# Examples

This directory contains various examples of how to use `structex`. Small examples with
minimal external dependencies are provided as single files. Larger examples are provided
as their own crate so their dependencies are clear and the code is self contained.

The `ad_regex` directory contains a modified version of the regular expression engine from
the [ad][0] text editor that supports matching against streams.
