### Please describe the change / addition you'd like to see made

- What kind of feature is it that you are requesting?
- Is this completely new functionality, or an enhancement to existing functionality?
- What is the utility provided by this feature and how does it integrate with the
  existing features and design of `ad`?


### Is this a feature you have seen in other text editors?

If so, please provide any links or reference to the existing implementation
and some details on how the feature is used.

> Please note that `ad` is minimal by design and is not aiming to add _every_
> feature found in other text editors. There are a lot of fantastic editors
> available, but one of the important things that makes them great is their
> variety and focus on a specific design.
